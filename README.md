# React Redux Base

## Npm commands
1. **Run the app**. `yarn start` or `npm start`
2. **Build the app**. `yarn build` or `npm run build`
3. **Lint the app**. `yarn lint` or `npm run lint`
4. **Test the app**. `yarn test` or `npm run test`

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Create the environment variables files in root folder(.env.dev, .env.staging and .env.prod):

  `.env.example` example:
  ```
    API_URL=http://your-api-url.com
    CABLE_URL=wss://your-api-url.com/cable
    AWS_BUCKET=bucket
    AWS_REGION=region
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret_key
  ```
4. Start the dev server: `yarn start` or `npm start -s`

## Running script with different environments
To change the set of environment variables for a script it's needed to run ENV=my_environment before the script.

For example: `ENV=staging yarn build`

## Initial Machine Setup
**Install [Node 4.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)** - (6.0 or greater is recommended for optimal build performance). Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

**Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)** - Fast, reliable, and secure package manager

## Deploying to AWS S3
1. **Add the environment variables for each .env** AWS_BUCKET, AWS_REGION, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
2. **Run the command to deploy with an environment** `ENV=your_environment yarn deploy`
